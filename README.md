# SSR Performance Stencil vs React

This Repo tries to show how the performance of ssr is degraded when using React components generated by stencil

TL:DR
This test uses this [code](react/src/ssrRender.ts)

```
  const rawHtml = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(jsx);
  const { html } = await hydrate.renderToString(rawHtml);
  return html

```

## Benchmark

When we `renderToString` just one component the React and stencil render methods do not diverge too much

But when rendering 1000 components (for illustration purposes), the React and stencil render methods have a considerable performance difference

This is also true when rendering a React page that uses some stencil generated components.
